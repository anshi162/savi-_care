<h1><center><u>KIDNEY </u></center></h1>
<h2><u><i>Disease And Conditions Affecting The Kidney</i></u></h2>Any disease that 
affects the blood vessels, including diabetes, high blood pressure and atherosclerosis 
(hardening of the arteries), can impair the kidneys’ ability to filter blood and 
regulate fluids in the body. Disease and infection in other parts of the body can also 
trigger a kidney disorder. Because kidney impairment can be life-threatening, disorders
and diseases that may affect the kidney deserve prompt attention.<br>
Kidney disease often causes no symptoms until late in its course and can lead to 
end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal unless a dialysis machine is used or a kidney 
transplant is performed.<br>Conditions that can cause kidney disease include:<ul><li>
Obstruction</li><li> Urinary tract infections</li><li>Glomerular diseases</li></ul>
<h2><u><i> Signs And Symptoms</i></u></h2><ul><li>Swelling or puffiness, particularly 
around the eyes or in the face, wrists, abdomen, thighs or ankles<li>Urine that is foamy,
bloody or coffee-coloured<li>A decrease in the amount of urine<li>Problems urinating, 
such as a burning feeling or abnormal discharge during urination, or a change in the 
frequency of urination, especially at night<li>mid-back pain (flank), below the ribs, 
near where the kidneys are located<li>High blood pressure.
<h2><u><i>Tests</i></u></h2><h3>Tests commonly used for screening and diagnosis ―</h3>
There are several tests commonly used to help the healthcare professional recognise if 
you have kidney or urinary disease. A blood sample can be analysed for creatinine (and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) and urea. The level of these waste products 
in the blood increases as kidney filtration declines. Abnormal results are usually the 
first sign that kidney disease is present. A urine sample is typically also examined and
analysed (urinalysis) as part of routine screening. This set of tests looks for indicators 
of kidney and urinary disease such as red blood cells, white blood cells (WBCs or 
leukocytes), and protein in the urine. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, you 
should have estimated GFR and albumin creatinine ratio checked annually to detect kidney 
disease in its early stages. If you are a current smoker, are obese, have established 
CVD, a family history of chronic kidney disease or are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait 
islander origin and are aged 35 years or older you should have estimated GFR and albumin
creatinine ratio checked every two years. When you have symptoms suggesting infection,
a urine culture can confirm the presence of a bacterial infection.
<h3>Tests to monitor kidney function ― </h3> If you have been diagnosed with a kidney 
disease, your health care provider will request laboratory tests to help monitor kidney 
function. Blood levels of urea, creatinine and estimated GFR are measured from time to 
time to see if the kidney disease is getting worse. The amount of calcium and phosphate 
in the blood and the balance of serum and urine electrolytes can also be measured, as 
these are often affected by kidney disease. Haemoglobin, measured as part of a full blood
count (FBC) may be measured (the kidneys make a hormone, erythropoietin, that controls 
red blood cell production). Urine albumin/creatinine ratio can be used to test the 
effects of treatment in diabetes and Urine total protein in nephrotic syndrome (a 
condition where the kidneys leak large amounts of protein into the urine). Parathyroid 
hormone, which controls calcium levels, is often increased in kidney disease and it may
be checked to see if bone damage is developing that requires treatment.
<h3>Imaging techniques―</h3> If blockage to the flow of urine or kidney damage which 
might alter the shape or size of the kidney or urinary tract is suspected, a picture of 
the kidneys can be helpful. Imaging techniques such as an ultrasound, CT scan (computed
tomography), isotope scan, or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) may be used. Various x-ray 
procedures can also be employed, such as: an intravenous urogram, micturating cystogram 
(picture whilst passing urine), or renal arteriogram (which looks at the flow of blood in
the kidney).
<h3>Kidney biopsy ― </h3>A biopsy can determine the cause of protein or blood in the 
urine. Analysing a small piece of kidney tissue can reveal the nature and extent of 
structural damage to a kidney. A biopsy, obtained using a biopsy needle and diagnostic 
imaging equipment, is often useful when disease of the glomerular filter is suspected.
<h2><u><i>Treatments</i></u></h2>Treatment varies depending on the type of kidney or urinary
disease present. In general, the earlier kidney or urinary disease is recognised, the
more likely it is to be treatable and resolved without permanent damage. Dietary 
restrictions, drug therapy and surgical procedures may be appropriate. If the kidneys can
no longer effectively remove waste and water from the body, a dialysis machine used 
several times a week can take over kidney filtration. Kidney transplant surgery is 
another option when kidneys fail. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, control of
your blood pressure and blood sugar is extremely important to prevent or minimise kidney
damage. Other medications may be used to relieve some of the symptoms of kidney disease, 
such as anaemia and oedema, or to lower cholesterol in order to reduce the risk of heart
disease.
