<h1><center><u>THYROID</u></center></h1>
<h2><u><i>Overview</i></u></h2>
The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland just below the Adam's apple. 
This gland plays a very important role in controlling your body's metabolism, that is, 
how your body functions. It does this by producing thyroid hormones (thyroxine, or T4, 
and triiodothyronine, or T3), chemicals that travel through your blood to every part of
your body. Thyroid hormones affect almost all tissues in the body and regulate many 
aspects of metabolism.<h2><u><i>Goitre</i></u></h2>
A thyroid goitre is a dramatic enlargement of the thyroid gland. This rarely happens in 
developed countries because iodine supplementation of some foods is common and this 
prevents severe iodine deficiency. Goitres are often removed for cosmetic reasons or 
because they compress other vital structures of the neck, including the windpipe 
(trachea) and the tube that leads from your mouth to your stomach, the oesophagus.
<h2><u><i>Thyroiditis</i></u></h2>
Thyroiditis is inflammation of the thyroid gland. It may be associated with either 
hypo- or hyperthyroidism. It may be painful, feeling like a sore throat, or painless. 
Thyroiditis may be due to an autoimmune disorder (especially Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), an
infection, exposure to a chemical that is toxic to the thyroid, or due to an unknown
cause (idiopathic). Depending on the cause, it can be acute but transient or chronic.
<h2><u><i>Solitary thyroid nodule</i></u></h2>
A solitary thyroid nodule is a small lump on the thyroid gland. As many as 50 percent of 
the population will have a nodule somewhere in the thyroid, however, the overwhelming 
majority of these nodules are harmless. Occasionally, thyroid nodules can be cancerous 
and need to be treated.
<h2><u><i>Hyperthyroidism </i></u></h2>Hyperthyroidism means you have too much thyroid 
hormone. This causes a range of problems for the body and these are described in our 
article on Graves' disease. As well as Graves’ disease hyperthyroidism can be caused by 
a thyroid adenoma – a small benign tumour in the thyroid gland that produces excessive
thyroid hormones and by taking excessive amounts of thyroid hormone therapy.
<h2><u><i>Hypothyroidism</i></u></h2>Hypothyroidism means you have too little thyroid 
hormone. This causes many tissues to function abnormally. See our article on Hashimoto's
disease. Hypothyroidism is common and the onset can be very slow so that you can have 
hypothyroidism for a number of years before it is recognised and treated. Hypothyroidism 
can also develop after treatment of hyperthyroidism, especially after surgery or 
radioactive iodine treatment.
