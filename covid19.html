<h2>Why get tested?</h2>
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 occurs in in a number of situations.<ul><li>
The first goal is diagnostic testing in people with symptoms. The question being asked here is: are symptoms due to COVID-19 or something else such as the common cold or flu? This is the most important question because COVID-19 is highly infectious and infected people need to be isolated as soon as possible to prevent them transferring the infection to other people – this is called community transfer. If you have any of the symptoms that can occur with a COVID-19 infection,  you must get tested.
</li><li>A second reason to test is if you have been identified as being in a location close to someone who has COVID-19 – this will often be part of the Test and Trace process that the public health authorities in all states and territories use to limit the spread of infection. In this situation, you may not yet have symptoms and you may be at the start of the infection process, but it remains important to test and see whether you are infected.
</li><li>Another situation is when you have been placed in quarantine following COVID-19 diagnosis.  You will routinely be tested for COVID-19 on day 2, day 7 and day 12 of the quarantine period, or at any time you first experience symptoms of COVID 19. Tests are conducted before you can leave, it is necessary to confirm that you are no longer infectious. If you test negative, you can return to the community.
Testing may be required to ensure that you are not infectious prior to international travel.
Regular testing may be part of your employment requirements if you work on the front line in an area of higher risk, or with people who are vulnerable such as aged care, hospital or quarantine services.
</li><h2>Test preparation needed?</h2>
<h2><u>Sample</u></h2>
<h2>Nose (nasopharyngeal) swab</h2>
This is the most common way of being tested. A swab is carefully inserted into your nose (both sides) to pick up samples of mucus.
<h2>Throat (oropharyngeal) swab</h2>
This will take samples from around the tonsils and the back of your throat.
These swabs will be placed in a tube and sent to the lab for testing.
 
<h2>Any preparation?</h2>
None required
