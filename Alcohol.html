<h3> <u>TESTING   FOR   ALCOHOLISM </u> </h3>
<p>
Laboratory tests can help diagnose a case of alcoholism but no single laboratory test or combination of tests has been shown to be ideal for screening or diagnosis. There are, however, some tests that are useful in evaluating patients:
</p><p style="font-family:verdana;"><b><ul><li>
Carbohydrate-deficient form of transferrin (CDT)</b>, a molecule involved in iron transport in blood. CDT is elevated in the blood of heavy drinkers but raised levels can also be found in a number of medical conditions. It is not useful as a screening test for alcohol abuse but may be useful in
detecting those who have relapsed</li><li>
<b>Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)</b>, a liver enzyme that is increased by heavy alcohol intake but also by other forms of liver disease
</li><li>
<b>Mean cell volume (MCV)</b>, a measure of the size of red blood cells, which is increased by prolonged heavy drinking
A blood alcohol (ethanol) level can be used to determine if a person has been drinking alcohol recently but does not diagnose alcoholism
</li></ul></p><p>
The GGT result is more useful than the MCV result as a ‘red flag’ to raise the suspicion that the person is drinking too much. Both of these tests are relatively poor for screening or as diagnostic tests because conditions other than alcohol abuse or alcoholism can cause elevated levels.
</p><p>
Physical examination also may reveal signs suggestive of alcoholism, such as evidence of injuries, a visible network of enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel (called caput medusae), fluid in the abdomen (ascites), yellowish-tone to the skin, decreased testicular size in men and poor nutritional status.

<h3> <u>TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOLISM </u></h3>
<p>
Throughout Australia, specialist alcohol services are available. Some individuals will only need or want to learn to reduce or control their drinking while others will need to abstain from alcohol use. Alcohol services offer a wide range of interventions and treatments including brief interventions, motivational interviews, counselling,
 detoxification services and self-help groups. Detoxification (alcohol withdrawal) can be provided in a number of settings including hospital wards, alcohol treatment units and residential services.
</p><p>
A variety of drugs can be used to treat alcoholism. Benzodiazepines (Valium or similar drugs) are sometimes used during the first days after drinking stops to help a patient safely withdraw from alcohol. These drugs are not used beyond the first few days, however, because they may be very addictive.
</p><p>
Other drugs such as naltrexone can reduce the craving for alcohol and help prevent a person from returning, or relapsing, to heavy drinking.
</p>
Just as there is no one test for screening or diagnosing alcoholism, there is not one single drug that effectively treats alcoholism. In other words, no single drug is available that works in every case because body chemistries are slightly different and reasons for drinking are also different. Developing new and more effective drugs to treat alcoholism is a high priority for researchers.
