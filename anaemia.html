<h1><center><u> ANAEMIA </u></center></h1>
<h2><u><i>Overview</i></u></h2>

<h2><u><i>Symptoms</i></u></h2><p>
Anaemia can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, dizziness and 
drowsiness. Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable, with an increased risk
of maternal and child mortality. The prevalence of anaemia remains high globally, 
particularly in low-income settings, where a significant proportion of young children and
women of childbearing age can be assumed to be anaemic.<br>Iron deficiency anaemia has
also been shown to affect cognitive and physical development in children and reduce 
productivity in adults.</p>
Anaemia is an indicator of both poor nutrition and poor health. <br>It is problematic on 
its own, but it can also impact other global nutritional concerns such as stunting and
wasting, low birth weight and childhood overweight and obesity due to lack of energy to 
exercise.<br> School performance in children and reduced work productivity in adults due to 
anaemia can have further social and economic impacts for the individual and family.  
<h2><u><i>Treatments</i></u></h2><p>
While iron deficiency anaemia is the most common form and is relatively easy to treat 
through dietary changes, other forms of anaemia require health interventions that may be
less accessible. Accurate characterisation of anaemia is critical to understand the 
burden and epidemiology of this problem, for planning public health interventions, and 
for clinical care of people across the life course.</p><p>
WHO oversees several programmes across all WHO Regions to help reduce the prevalence of 
anaemia through treatment and prevention. These guidelines, policies and interventions 
aim to increase dietary diversity, improve infant feeding practices and improve the 
bioavailability and intake of micronutrients through fortification or supplementation 
with iron, folic acid and other vitamins and mineral. Social and behaviour change 
communication strategies are used to change nutrition-related behaviours. Interventions 
to address the underlying and basic causes of anaemia look at issues such as disease 
control, water, sanitation and hygiene, reproductive health and root causes such as 
poverty, lack of education and gender norms.  </p> 
In 2016, WHO started a five-year project to review its global guidelines for haemoglobin 
cut-offs used to define anaemia with the aim to provide evidence-informed recommendations
son assessing anaemia in individuals and populations.
