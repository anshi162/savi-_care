<h1><center><u> Diabetes </u></center></h1>
<h2><u><i>Overview</i></u></h2>Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by
elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious
damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 
diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or 
doesn't make enough insulin. In the past three decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes
has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as 
juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the 
pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, 
access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There 
is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. <br>
About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-
income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. 
Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing 
over the past few decades. 
<h2><u><i>Symptoms</i></u></h2><p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to 
urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These 
symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those
of type 1 diabetes, but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed 
several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it 
is important to be aware of risk factors. 
<h2><u><i>Prevention and treatment</i></u></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be 
prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent 
the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. These
include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings 
(school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of 
whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding 
smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids. <br>
The starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis â€“ the longer a 
person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are
likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should the
refore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic 
specialist assessment or treatment for complications. <br>
A series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what
type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control, 
through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control
of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and 
regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet,to facilitate early treatment.
